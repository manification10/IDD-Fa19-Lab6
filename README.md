# ChatBot

*MooBot by Ananya Paul Student*


## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**
I changed the code into a Ask me Anything format for https://www.instagram.com/chloemoomoomoo/. 
In my chatbot I am taking sentences as input, and looking for keywords for specific answers. Based on the keyword, I have constructed answers for Chloemoomoo and used her Instagram pictures and bakcground for the webpage. 
I changed the colour of text, added some shading and aligned background image. 
I also added audio to make the experience more fun. 


## Record someone trying out your ChatBot
